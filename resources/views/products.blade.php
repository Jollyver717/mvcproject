Although there are many different kinds of lumpia, the Shanghai version is distinguished by a savory filling made of ground pork or beef, carrots, onions, different seasonings, and (rarely) shrimp. Lumpiang Shanghai is a common dish served on special and festive occasions, but it is also frequently sold at numerous street stalls across the nation. Typically, a sweet and sour dipping sauce is served with this delectable and crispy snack.</p></div>

In the Philippines, tempura is a well-known street food, and the people there have their own tempura recipe and flavor. It is a fried Japanese dish that is either filled with batter-dipped vegetables or shelled shrimp. In the majority of the streets and open spaces in all of the provinces of the Philippines, you can find a wandering tempura vendor with his bike and cart. Since there are some tempura that are small and big, sizes are different precisely, but when it's already been boiled, it will just sprout from its raw small size, vendors can cook tempura while you wait in just their stance or bikes, and you can also choose your tempura pieces from their basket.</p></div>

Despite being comparable, pork isaw is frequently a little bit bigger and chewier than the chicken variety. Typically, soy sauce, oil, ketchup, garlic, and seasonings are used to make the marinade. It is crucial to thoroughly clean and boil the intestines before grilling them because this gets rid of all pathogens that are transmitted through food.</p></div>

There is only one kind of filling, which mainly consists of chopped or minced mutton, scallion and ginger. Hohhot shaomai features this extensive use of scallion and ginger, creating a dense combined scent, and a slightly spicy taste. The filling is put in the center of the wrapping and the border of the wrapping is loosely gathered above, forming a "neck" and a flower shaped top. It is then cooked by steaming or pan-frying.</p></div>
